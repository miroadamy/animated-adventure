# Assignment for the DevOps position

Source: [Opsfleet/Tech_Assignment_v1.2.0 | Trello](https://trello.com/b/eBz9XGwo/opsfleet-techassignmentv120)

At Opsfleet, the majority of our projects and ongoing tasks are related to Kubernetes, AWS, and GCP

You will find in this document a few examples of tasks we do on a day-to-day basis.

There are two task categories - technical and arch design.

You’re required to solve **both of them** and follow the instructions in the task description. Feel free to reach out with questions, especially if you’re not sure about something! The idea is to give us an opportunity to work together, not to gauge your ultimate DevOps skills.

Good luck!

## Solutions and instructions

Task 1 - see `./task-1-infra`

Task 2 - see `./task-2-architecture`
